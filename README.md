DDCustumPlugin
==============

Diamond Dominion Custom Plugin, with many scripts that could be fun for Bukkit developers. The server this was origionally for is long since deleted.

If you are a Bukkit Developer and you would like to see my work, go into src/net/diamonddominion/esaych to see all the modifications to my server. You will find this plugin is many smaller plugins combined.

This was designed for Bukkit 1.6.4, if there are errors, you may have to update some code.

Plugins include: 
- DDChat (a whole chat plugin)
- BeastSprint (sprinting 10x fast, with fire effects)
- ColorArmor (wear full leather and watch the colors change gradually)
- CrashPlayer (crash a player, instead of kick, much more evil)
- HeartBeat (allowed for web connection to alert owner with text when server is down)
- LaunchPad (much like portal 2)
- SignEdit (modify signs by looking at them)
- SpawnerSwitch (modify a spawner by looking at them)
- Trampoline (sponges make you fly high)
- Voodoo (grab a player's head, and use it to move them around)
- PlotMeOverride (basically connects plots you buy)
- TnTPunch (spawn tnt at the location towards where you punch)
- DonorShop (best teleporting ever, explosion in the roof, fly up into shop, then roof repairs)
- EndDragonRespawn (respawns dragon and ender crystals)
- FairFly and FairGod (disables fly and god of player when in combat)
- LegitWarzone (force donor players to have legit circumstances with lesser players)
- SpawnMusic (loop music in a record player in spawn)
- StaffVotes (add a vote to a chest, staff chose yes or no)
- WarpWild (drops you off in a random place in the world)
- WelcomeBook (first time book)
- WelcomeSign (scrolls a sign)
- AutoConfiscate (takes items from player inventories that are illegal)
- DrunkenWizard (sneak, get dizzy, teleport in a flash of fire)
- VirtualChest (stores items in a remote location far from player)

These plugins are useful to those who want to get code like this for their own developing. I only request that in your source (even if it is modified) you reference where you got the code, that being me, Esaych, or Samuel Holmberg.

You will find many times where a database is used to store data, or read data. You will also notice that I did the absolute minimum in storing data in a text, yml, or json file. I prefer storing information inside the game, or close by. You will find examples of using chests, block ids, and item names to store data, as well as methods that helped prevent data loss during crashes of the server.
